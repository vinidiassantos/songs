There were bells on a hill
<span class="chord">Gm</span>              <span class="chord">C7</span>
But I never heard them ringing
<span class="chord">F</span>               <span class="chord">Am</span>              <span class="chord">Dm</span>
No, I never heard them at all
<span class="chord">Gm</span>              <span class="chord">C7</span>   <span class="chord">F</span>
Till there was you

<span class="chord">F</span>               <span class="chord">Am</span>              <span class="chord">Dm</span>
There were birds in the sky
<span class="chord">Gm</span>              <span class="chord">C7</span>
But I never saw them winging
<span class="chord">F</span>               <span class="chord">Am</span>              <span class="chord">Dm</span>
No, I never saw them at all
<span class="chord">Gm</span>              <span class="chord">C7</span>   <span class="chord">F</span>
Till there was you

<span class="chord">Bb</span>              <span class="chord">Gm</span>
Then there was music
<span class="chord">C7</span>              <span class="chord">F</span>
And wonderful roses
<span class="chord">Bb</span>              <span class="chord">Gm</span>
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
<span class="chord">C7</span>
Of dawn and dew

<span class="chord">F</span>               <span class="chord">Am</span>              <span class="chord">Dm</span>
There was love all around
<span class="chord">Gm</span>              <span class="chord">C7</span>
But I never heard it singing
<span class="chord">F</span>               <span class="chord">Am</span>              <span class="chord">Dm</span>
No, I never heard it at all
<span class="chord">Gm</span>              <span class="chord">C7</span>   <span class="chord">F</span>
Till there was you
