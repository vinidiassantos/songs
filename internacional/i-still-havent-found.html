    <main>

I have climbed highest mountains,
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you,
only to be with you

I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls,
these city walls
Only to be with you

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

I have kissed honey lips,
felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire,
this burning desire

I have spoke with the tongue of angels,
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night,
I was cold as a stone

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

I believe in the kingdom come
Then... my shame
You know I believe it
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
