<span class="chord">G</span>               <span class="chord">D/F#</span>            <span class="chord">Em</span>             <span class="chord">F</span> <span class="chord">C</span> <span class="chord">Cm</span>
There are places I'll remember all my life though some have changed
<span class="chord">G</span>               <span class="chord">D/F#</span>            <span class="chord">Em</span>             <span class="chord">F</span> <span class="chord">C</span> <span class="chord">Cm</span>
Some forever not for better, some have gone and some remain
<span class="chord">Em</span>             <span class="chord">C</span>
All these places had their moments
<span class="chord">F</span>             <span class="chord">G</span>
With lovers and friends I still can recall
<span class="chord">Em</span>             <span class="chord">A7</span>
Some are dead and some are living
<span class="chord">C</span>             <span class="chord">Cm</span>             <span class="chord">G</span>
In my life I've loved them all

<span class="chord">G</span>               <span class="chord">D/F#</span>            <span class="chord">Em</span>             <span class="chord">F</span> <span class="chord">C</span> <span class="chord">Cm</span>
But of all these friends and lovers, there is no one compares with you
<span class="chord">G</span>               <span class="chord">D/F#</span>            <span class="chord">Em</span>             <span class="chord">F</span> <span class="chord">C</span> <span class="chord">Cm</span>
And these memories lose their meaning when I think of love as something new
<span class="chord">Em</span>             <span class="chord">C</span>
Though I know I'll never lose affection
<span class="chord">F</span>             <span class="chord">G</span>
For people and things that went before
<span class="chord">Em</span>             <span class="chord">A7</span>
I know I'll often stop and think about them
<span class="chord">C</span>             <span class="chord">Cm</span>             <span class="chord">G</span>
In my life I'll love you more

<span class="chord">C</span>             <span class="chord">Cm</span>             <span class="chord">G</span>
In my life I'll love you more
