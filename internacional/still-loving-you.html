Time, it needs time to win back your love again
<span class="chord">C</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
I will be there, I will be there

<span class="chord">Am</span>                      <span class="chord">F</span>
Love, only love can bring back your love someday
<span class="chord">C</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
I will be there, I will be there

<span class="chord">Am</span>                      <span class="chord">F</span>
Fight, babe, I'll fight to win back your love again
<span class="chord">C</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
I will be there, I will be there

Love, only love can break down the walls someday

I will be there, I will be there

<span class="chord">F</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
If we'd go again all the way from the start
<span class="chord">Am</span>                      <span class="chord">F</span>
I would try to change the things that killed our love
<span class="chord">C</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Your pride has built a wall so strong that I can't get through
<span class="chord">F</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Is there really no chance to start once again?
<span class="chord">Am</span>
I'm loving you

<span class="chord">Am</span>                      <span class="chord">F</span>
Try, baby try to trust in my love again
<span class="chord">C</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
I will be there, I will be there

<span class="chord">Am</span>                      <span class="chord">F</span>
Love, our love just shouldn't be thrown away
<span class="chord">C</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
I will be there, I will be there

<span class="chord">F</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
If we'd go again all the way from the start
<span class="chord">Am</span>                      <span class="chord">F</span>
I would try to change the things that killed our love
<span class="chord">C</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Yes, I've hurt your pride and I know what you've been through
<span class="chord">F</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
You should give me a chance, this can't be the end
<span class="chord">Am</span>
I'm still loving you
