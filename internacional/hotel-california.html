      <pre>
<span class="chord">Bm</span>               <span class="chord">F#7</span>
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
<span class="chord">A</span>                <span class="chord">E</span>
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
<span class="chord">G</span>                <span class="chord">D</span>
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
<span class="chord">Em</span>               <span class="chord">F#7</span>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night

<span class="chord">Bm</span>               <span class="chord">F#7</span>
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
<span class="chord">A</span>                <span class="chord">E</span>
And I was thinking to myself, this could be heaven or this could be hell
<span class="chord">G</span>                <span class="chord">D</span>
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
<span class="chord">Em</span>               <span class="chord">F#7</span>
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say

<span class="chord">G</span>                
Welcome to the Hotel California, 
<span class="chord">D</span>              <span class="chord">F#7</span> 
such a lovely place (such a lovely place) Such a lovely face,
<span class="chord">Bm</span>
plenty of room at the Hotel California,
<span class="chord">G</span>                <span class="chord">D</span>
Any time of year (any time of year), you can find it here

<span class="chord">Em</span>               <span class="chord">F#7</span>
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
<span class="chord">A</span>                <span class="chord">E</span>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
<span class="chord">G</span>                <span class="chord">D</span>
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
<span class="chord">Em</span>               <span class="chord">F#7</span>
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

<span class="chord">Bm</span>               <span class="chord">F#7</span>
So I called up the captain, please bring me my wine
<span class="chord">A</span>                   <span class="chord">E</span>
He said,    we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine
<span class="chord">G</span>                <span class="chord">D</span>
And still those voices are calling from far away
<span class="chord">Em</span>               <span class="chord">F#7</span>
Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say

<span class="chord">G</span>                
Welcome to the Hotel California, 
<span class="chord">D</span>                <span class="chord">F#7</span> 
such a lovely place (such a lovely place)   Such a lovely face,
<span class="chord">Bm</span>
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
<span class="chord">G</span>                <span class="chord">D</span>
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis

<span class="chord">Em</span>               <span class="chord">F#7</span>
Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
<span class="chord">A</span>                <span class="chord">E</span>
And she said,    we are all just prisoners here of our own device
<span class="chord">G</span>                <span class="chord">D</span>
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
<span class="chord">Em</span>               <span class="chord">F#7</span>
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast

<span class="chord">Bm</span>               <span class="chord">F#7</span>
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
<span class="chord">A</span>                <span class="chord">E</span>
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
<span class="chord">G</span>                <span class="chord">D</span>
"Relax," said the night man, "we are programmed to receive
<span class="chord">Em</span>               <span class="chord">F#7</span>
You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave!"
