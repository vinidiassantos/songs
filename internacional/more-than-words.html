<span class="chord">G</span>             <span class="chord">C</span>               <span class="chord">Am</span>             <span class="chord">D</span>
Saying I love you is not the words I want to hear from you
<span class="chord">G</span>             <span class="chord">C</span>               <span class="chord">Am</span>             <span class="chord">D</span>
It's not that I want you not to say but if you only knew

<span class="chord">G</span>             <span class="chord">C</span>               <span class="chord">Am</span>
How easy it would be to show me how you feel
<span class="chord">D</span>             <span class="chord">G</span>             <span class="chord">C</span>
More than words is all you have to do to make it real
<span class="chord">Am</span>             <span class="chord">D</span>
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
<span class="chord">G</span>
'Cause I'd already know

<span class="chord">C</span>             <span class="chord">Am</span>             <span class="chord">D</span>
What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
<span class="chord">G</span>             <span class="chord">C</span>             <span class="chord">Am</span>             <span class="chord">D</span>
More than words to show you feel that your love for me is real

<span class="chord">G</span>             <span class="chord">C</span>             <span class="chord">Am</span>             <span class="chord">D</span>
What would you say if I took those words away?
<span class="chord">G</span>             <span class="chord">C</span>             <span class="chord">Am</span>             <span class="chord">D</span>
Then you couldn't make things new just by saying I love you

<span class="chord">G</span> <span class="chord">C</span> <span class="chord">Am</span> <span class="chord">D</span>
More than words
