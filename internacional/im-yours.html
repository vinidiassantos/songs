<span class="chord">Am</span> <span class="chord">F</span> <span class="original">I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back</span>

<span class="chord">C</span> <span class="original">Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest</span>

<span class="chord">G</span> <span class="original">And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention</span>

<span class="chord">Am</span> <span class="chord">F</span> <span class="original">I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some</span>


<span class="chord">C</span> <span class="chord">G</span> <span class="original">But I won't hesitate no more, no more</span>

<span class="chord">Am</span> <span class="chord">F</span> <span class="original">Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love</span>

<span class="chord">C</span> <span class="original">Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing</span>

<span class="chord">G</span> <span class="original">We're just one big family</span>

<span class="chord">F</span> <span class="chord">Am</span> <span class="original">It's our God-forsaken right to be loved love loved love love</span>

<span class="original">But do you want to come on</span>
<span class="original">Scooch on over closer dear, and I will nibble your ear</span>


<span class="chord">C</span> <span class="original">I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror</span>

<span class="chord">G</span> <span class="original">And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer</span>

<span class="chord">Am</span> <span class="original">But my breath fogged up the glass</span>

<span class="chord">F</span> <span class="original">And so I drew a new face and I laughed</span>

<span class="chord">C</span> <span class="original">I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason</span>

<span class="chord">G</span> <span class="original">To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons</span>

<span class="chord">Am</span> <span class="chord">F</span> <span class="original">It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue</span>


<span class="chord">C</span> <span class="chord">G</span> <span class="original">But I won't hesitate no more, no more</span>

<span class="chord">Am</span> <span class="chord">F</span> <span class="original">It cannot wait, I'm yours</span>


<span class="chord">C</span> <span class="original">Open up your mind and see like me</span>
<span class="chord">G</span> <span class="original">(I won't hesitate)</span>

<span class="chord">Am</span> <span class="original">Open up your plans and damn you're free</span>
<span class="chord">G</span> <span class="original">(No more, no more)</span>

<span class="chord">Am</span> <span class="original">Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours</span>
<span class="chord">G</span> <span class="original">(It cannot wait, I'm sure)</span>


<span class="original">So please don't, please don't, please don't</span>
<span class="original">(There's no need to complicate)</span>
<span class="original">There's no need to complicate</span>
<span class="original">(Our time is short)</span>

<span class="original">(This is our fate)</span>
