<span class="chord">F</span>               <span class="chord">C</span>
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
<span class="chord">C7</span>              <span class="chord">F</span>
Take a sad song and make it better
<span class="chord">Bb</span>              <span class="chord">F</span>
Remember to let her into your heart
<span class="chord">C</span>              <span class="chord">F</span>
Then you can start to make it better

<span class="chord">F</span>               <span class="chord">C</span>
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
<span class="chord">C7</span>              <span class="chord">F</span>
You were made to go out and get her
<span class="chord">Bb</span>              <span class="chord">F</span>
The minute you let her under your skin
<span class="chord">C</span>              <span class="chord">F</span>
Then you begin to make it better

<span class="chord">F7</span>              <span class="chord">Bb</span>
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
<span class="chord">Gm</span>              <span class="chord">C</span>
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
<span class="chord">F7</span>              <span class="chord">Bb</span>
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
<span class="chord">Gm</span>              <span class="chord">C</span>
By making his world a little colder

<span class="chord">F</span>               <span class="chord">C</span>
Hey Jude, don't let me down
<span class="chord">C7</span>              <span class="chord">F</span>
You have found her, now go and get her
<span class="chord">Bb</span>              <span class="chord">F</span>
Remember to let her into your heart
<span class="chord">C</span>              <span class="chord">F</span>
Then you can start to make it better

<span class="chord">F</span>               <span class="chord">Eb</span>
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
<span class="chord">Bb</span>              <span class="chord">F</span>
You're waiting for someone to perform with
<span class="chord">F</span>               <span class="chord">Eb</span>
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
<span class="chord">Bb</span>              <span class="chord">C</span>
The movement you need is on your shoulder

<span class="chord">F</span>               <span class="chord">C</span>
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
<span class="chord">C7</span>              <span class="chord">F</span>
Take a sad song and make it better
<span class="chord">Bb</span>              <span class="chord">F</span>
Remember to let her under your skin
<span class="chord">C</span>              <span class="chord">F</span>
Then you'll begin to make it better

<span class="chord">F</span>   <span class="chord">Eb</span>   <span class="chord">Bb</span>   <span class="chord">F</span>
Na na na na-na-na na

Na-na-na na, hey Jude
