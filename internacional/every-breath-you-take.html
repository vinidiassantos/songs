Every breath you take, every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take
I'll be watching you

Every single day, every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay
I'll be watching you

Oh, can't you see, you belong to me?
How my poor heart aches, with every step you take

Every move you make, every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby please

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Oh, can't you see, you belong to me?
How my poor heart aches, with every step you take

Every move you make, every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Every move you make, every step you take
I'll be watching you

I'll be watching you,
(every breath you take)
(Every move you make)
(Every bond you break)
(Every step you take) I'll be watching you
(Every single day)
(Every word you say)
(Every game you play) I'll be watching you
(Every move you make)
(Every bond you break)
(Every smile you fake)
(Every claim you stake) I'll be watching you
(Every single day)
(Every word you say)
(Every game you play) I'll be watching you
