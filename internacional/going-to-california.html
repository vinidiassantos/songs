      <pre>
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Spent my days with a woman unkind
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Made up my mind to make a new start
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Going to California with an aching in my heart

<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Someone told me there's a girl out there
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair

<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Took my chances on a big jet plane
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Never let them tell you that they're all the same
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
The sea was red and the sky was grey
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today

<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
As the children of the sun began to awake

<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Seems that the wrath of the gods
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
I think I might be sinking

<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high

<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
To find a queen without a king
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
La la la la

<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born

<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems
