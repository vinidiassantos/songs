Is it getting better?
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now?
You got someone to blame

You say
one love,
one life
When it's one need
in the night

One love,
we get to share it
It leaves you baby
if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love,
and you want me to go without

Well it's
too late
tonight
To drag the past out
into the light

We're one,
but we're not the same
We get to carry each other,
carry each other

One
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus,
to the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much?
More than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now
it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other,
then we do it again

You say love is a temple,
love the higher law
Love is a temple
Love the higher law
You ask me to enter
But then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on
To what you've got
When all you've got is hurt

One love
One blood
One life
You've got to do what you should

One life with each other
Sisters,
Brothers

One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other,
carry each other

One
One
