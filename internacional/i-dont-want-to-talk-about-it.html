I can tell by your eyes that you've probably been crying forever
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
And the stars in the sky don't mean nothing to you, they're a mirror

<span class="chord">Em</span>                      <span class="chord">A</span>
I don't want to talk about it
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">Bm</span>
How you broke my heart
<span class="chord">Em</span>                      <span class="chord">A</span>
If I stay here just a little bit longer
<span class="chord">Em</span>                      <span class="chord">A</span>
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?

<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
My heart

<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
If I stand all alone, will the shadow hide the color of my heart?
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
Blue for the tears, black for the night's fears
<span class="chord">D</span>                      <span class="chord">G</span>
The stars in the sky don't mean nothing to you, they're a mirror

<span class="chord">Em</span>                      <span class="chord">A</span>
I don't want to talk about it

How you broke my heart
<span class="chord">Em</span>                      <span class="chord">A</span>
If I stay here just a little bit longer
<span class="chord">Em</span>                      <span class="chord">A</span>
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
